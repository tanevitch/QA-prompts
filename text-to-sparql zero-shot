For each inputed question generate a SPARQL SELECT query that answers the question, using only the vocabulary (classes, data properties, and object properties) defined in the provided ontology. 

Constraints:
- Only use the ontology provided below; do not use any external resources or assumptions.
- Do not add any text except the classification label and the SPARQL query. 
- Assume that the engine supports reasoning/inference.
- Ensure the query follows SPARQL syntax and compiles correctly.
- The SPARQL query must directly correspond to the input question.
